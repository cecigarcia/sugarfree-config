= SugarfreeConfig

Configuration handling the easy way.

SugarfreeConfig allows easy access to per Rails environment config values
stored in a YAML file.

SugarfreeConfig only works with Rails! since SugarfreecConfig 1.1.0 works
with rails 3 and ruby 1.9.1

== Installation

Just install the gem from Gemcutter

  $ gem install sugarfree-config --source http://gemcutter.org

== Notes on rails 3

In rails 2.x gems were required after Rails.root was initialized. Default rails 3.0
application generator uses Bundler, and auto-requires all gems before application
initialization. This could be solved forcing the bundler not to require the gem.
In your Gemfile:

  gem 'sugarfree-config', :require => false

and adding the require on the app's initializer

module MyApplication
  class Application < Rails::Application
    require 'sugarfree-config'
    ...
  end
end

== Usage

Config must be stored in "#{RAILS_ROOT}/config/config.yml" and must have
at least a section for each RAILS_ENV

Configuration can be accessed like this

  SugarfreeConfig.a.b.c #=> 'value'

which will expect a config file like (given development env)

  development:
    a:
      b:
        c: 'value'

otherwise a ConfigKeyException will be raised

Configuration is accessed through a ConfigIterator that (as its name says) is
an iterator and cannot be reused. However there is a workaround to allow the
repeated use of scoped iterators.

  # This doesn't work
  var a_config = SugarfreeConfig.a
  a_config.b.c #=> 'value'
  a_config.b.c #=> Ups!!! tried to grab config.a.b.c.b.c

  # Workaround
  var a_config = SugarfreeConfig.a
  a_config.dup.b.c #=> 'value'
  a_config.dup.b.c #=> 'value'

== Further customization

By default Sugarfree-config caches in memory the YAML file. If you want the gem
to reload this file each time a value is accessed (like in development mode)
you must force the initialization of the SugarfreeConfig module.

This could be a possible Rails initializer:

  SugarfreeConfig.init(Rails.env.development?) # True to force reload each time

  class Object
    # For people who prefer app_config.a.b.c instead of SugarfreeConfig.a.b.c
    def app_config
      SugarfreeConfig
    end
  end
